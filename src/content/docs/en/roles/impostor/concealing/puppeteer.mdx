As the Puppeteer, you can use your kill button to manipulate another player. This player will become *puppeted*. After a configurable amount of time, the *puppeted* player will become *manipulated* and kill any player that enters their killing range **except** players with the Lazy Guy role, players with the Lazy add-on, or other Impostors, including the Puppeteer themself (unless configured otherwise).

A layer of difficulty can be added to the role by configuring a lower maximum number of puppets the Puppeteer can make, or having the Puppeteer die after using all of their allocated puppet abilities. There is also an option to have the *puppeted* player die with their victim.

</RoleOption>

<RoleOption time={{default: 3}}>
  <Fragment slot='title'>
    ### Minimum Delay Before The Puppeted Player Can Kill

<RoleOption toggle={{default: false}}>
  <Fragment slot='title'>
    ### Manipulation Ends After a Specific Time

      <Fragment slot='title'>
        #### Time After The Manipulation Ends
      </Fragment>
      The amount of time until the *manipulated* player loses the effect.

</RoleOption>

<RoleOption toggle={{default: false}}>
  <Fragment slot='title'>
    ### Bypass Lazy

<RoleOption toggle={{default: false}}>
  <Fragment slot='title'>
    ### Puppet Can Kill Other Impostors
  </Fragment>
  If enabled, the *puppeted* player can kill other impostors — but not the Puppeteer.
</RoleOption>

<RoleOption toggle={{default: false}}>
  <Fragment slot='title'>
    ### Puppet Can Kill The Puppeteer
  </Fragment>
  If enabled, the *puppeted* player can kill the Puppeteer who puppeted them.  
  Combining this with a very low [minimum delay](#minimum-delay-before-the-puppeted-player-can-kill) (0-2 seconds) can be extremely punishing for the Puppeteer.
</RoleOption>

<RoleOption number={{default: 5}}>
  <Fragment slot='title'>
    ### Maximum Number of Puppets
  </Fragment>
  The maximum number of times the Puppeteer can puppet. Only successful puppets count, and this does not reset after meetings.
</RoleOption>

<RoleOption toggle={{default: false}}>
  <Fragment slot='title'>
    ### Puppeteer Dies After Running Out Of Puppets
  </Fragment>
  If enabled, the Puppeteer will die after using their last puppet. Only successful puppets count.
</RoleOption>

<RoleOption toggle={{default: false}}>
  <Fragment slot='title'>
    ### Puppet Dies Along With The Victim
  </Fragment>
  If enabled, the *puppeted* player will die along with the player they kill while manipulated.
</RoleOption>
