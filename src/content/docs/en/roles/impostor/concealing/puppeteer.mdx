As the Puppeteer, you can use your kill button to manipulate another player. This player will become *puppeted*. After a configurable amount of time, the *puppeted* player will become *manipulated* and kill any player that enters their killing range **except** players with the Lazy Guy role, players with the Lazy add-on, or other Impostors, including the Puppeteer themself (unless configured otherwise).

A layer of difficulty can be added to the role by configuring a lower maximum number of puppets the Puppeteer can make, or having the Puppeteer die after using all of their allocated puppet abilities. There is also an option to have the *puppeted* player die with their victim.

<Aside type="caution">
Combining this with a very low [Minimum Delay Before The Puppeted Player Can Kill](#minimum-delay-before-the-puppeted-player-can-kill) (0-2 seconds) can be quite harsh on the Puppeteer, as the puppet has the chance to kill them almost instantly!
