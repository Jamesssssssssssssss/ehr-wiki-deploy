## Role Description

The **Vulture** is a Neutral Evil role. When the Vulture attempts to report a body, and its eat ability cooldown is up, the body will be eaten by the Vulture. Bodies eaten by the Vulture cannot be reported. If the Vulture's eat ability is still on cooldown, they report the body regularly.

The Vulture also has a limit on how many bodies it can eat per round. If this limit is reached, regardless of the eat ability cooldown, the body will be reported instead of eaten. The Vulture must eat a certain amount of bodies during the game to win alone.
