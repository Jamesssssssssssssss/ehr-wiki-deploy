## Role Description

The **Thief** is a Neutral Evil role that cannot win while it is this role. It is one of the only Neutral Evil roles to have a kill button, which must be used to kill an evil-aligned player and take on that player's role. Upon successfully obtaining a new role, the Thief's win condition changes to that of the new role.
