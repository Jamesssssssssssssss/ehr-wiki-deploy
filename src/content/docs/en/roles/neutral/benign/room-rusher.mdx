## Role Description

The **Room Rusher** is a Neutral Benign role. The Room Rusher's gameplay is similar to the game mode it is based off of, Room Rush. The Room Rusher is assigned a timer and a room at the start of the game. Each time the Room Rusher gets to the room before the timer ends, they get 1 point and are assigned a new room and a new timer. The timer can be longer or shorter depending on the distance of the room from the current location of the Room Rusher.

If the Room Rusher doesn't get to the target room before the timer ends, the Room Rusher suicides, with the death reason **Suicide**. The Room Rusher gets a certain amount of vents they can use per game, based on settings.

If the Room Rusher reaches a certain amount of points by the end of the game, they win with the winning team. The Room Rusher may continue to travel to rooms after satisfying their win condition, but that will only increase their point count, and will not have any effect. The Room Rusher will also no longer suicide after reaching the point requirement. The Room Rusher will see the timer above their head, and may or may not see the name of the room they must go to or an arrow pointing to it.
