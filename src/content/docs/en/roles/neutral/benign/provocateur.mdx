## Role Description

The **Provocateur** is a Neutral Benign role. **It stands out as one of the few Benign roles equipped with a killing ability.** The Provocateur is granted one kill per game, and their primary win condition is achieved if the player they target and kill ultimately loses the game.
When the Provocateur executes this ability, the target's death reason is registered as **Destroyed**. This death reason is notably shared with the [**Juggernaut**](../../killing/juggernaut).
