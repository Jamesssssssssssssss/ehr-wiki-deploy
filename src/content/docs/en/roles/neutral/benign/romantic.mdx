## Role Description

The **Romantic** is a Neutral Benign role. The Romantic can use its kill button to choose its partner. The Romantic sees a rose-colored heart symbol next to its partner's name, only visible to the Romantic. If the Romantic's partner is enabled to see the Romantic, they will see the same symbol next to the Romantic's name, only visible to the Partner. If the Romantic and the Partner are alive, they win with each other normally. The Romantic can use the kill button on anyone after choosing a partner to give the partner a temporary shield from attacks.

If the Partner of the Romantic dies, the Romantic will become a different role, depending on what the partner's role was:

* If the Partner had any type of kill button and wasn't an Impostor, the Romantic will become that **exact role of the Partner**.
* If the partner was a Neutral that couldn't kill, or if the partner died by something that wasn't caused by a different player (like a suicide or disconnecting), the Romantic will become the [**Ruthless Romantic**](../../killing/ruthless-romantic).
* If the partner was an Impostor role, the Romantic will become a [**Renegade**](../../../impostor/madmate/renegade).
* If the partner was none of the previously mentioned cases, the Romantic will become the [**Vengeful Romantic**](../../killing/vengeful-romantic).

It is also important to note that the Romantic is a **Unique role**, meaning its Max setting is not configurable, and is always set to 1.

**Related Roles:** [**Ruthless Romantic**](../../killing/ruthless-romantic), [**Vengeful Romantic**](../../killing/vengeful-romantic), [**Renegade**](../../../impostor/madmate/renegade)
