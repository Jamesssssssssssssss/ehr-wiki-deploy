## Role Description

The **Hater** is a Neutral Benign role. Despite having the Benign alignment, it is able to kill. It is one of the only roles with this property. The Hater has Impostor vision by default, and has no kill cooldown. However, the Hater is only capable of killing players with the [**Lovers**](../../../add-on/mixed/lovers) add-on, recruiters, like [**Cultist**](../../killing/cultist) or [**Jackal**](../../killing/jackal), or recruited players, like players with the [**Charmed**](../../../add-on/betrayal/charmed) add-on or [**Sidekick**(s)](../../killing/sidekick). If the Hater attempts to kill a player that doesn't meet any of these requirements, the Hater will suicide, with the death reason **Misfire**. The Hater wins with the winning team if they kill at least one player during the game.
