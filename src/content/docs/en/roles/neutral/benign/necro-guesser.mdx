## Role Description

The **Necro-Guesser** is a Neutral Benign role. The Necro-Guesser is able to guess, however unlike other guessers, can only guess the roles of **dead** players. The Necro-Guesser must guess a set amount of dead players' roles to satisfy their win condition and win with the winning team. Guessing the role of a dead player has no effect on them and only progresses the Necro-Guesser's win condition.
