## Role Description

The **Impartial** is a Neutral Benign role. Despite having the Benign alignment, it is able to kill. It is one of the only roles with this property. The Impartial must kill a set amount of players from each team to win with the winning team. The amount of players the Impartial must kill is displayed next to their name. It is important to note that the Impartial must kill the **exact** amount of players from each faction, and does not win if it kills more than the maximum amount, unless configured otherwise.
