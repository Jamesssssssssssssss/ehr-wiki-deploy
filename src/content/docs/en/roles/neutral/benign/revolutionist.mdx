## Role Description

The **Revolutionist** is a Neutral Benign role. The Revolutionist must use their kill button on a player and stay near them for a few seconds. An empty brown circle will display next to the name of the target, which will disappear if moving far away from the target. If you stay close to the target, a full brown circle will replace the empty one, and that target will be **tagged**. These circles are only visible to the Revolutionist.

There is a chance, configured by the host, that the tagged player will be killed by the Revolutionist. Players that die to this have the death reason **Sacrifice**.

The Revolutionist must tag a certain amount of players. When this amount is reached, all tagged players will be instructed to vent, and will have a limited time to do so. If all tagged players vent in time, the Revolutionist and all tagged players win. Otherwise, any players that don't vent will also die with the death reason of **Sacrifice**. It is important to note that Sacrificed players are still able to win with the Revolutionist and their team.
