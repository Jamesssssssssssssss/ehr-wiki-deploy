## Role Description

The **Seamstress** is a Neutral Pariah role. They may sew two players together using their **Shapeshift menu**.

Interactions performed on one sewn player (such as ability use or status effects) will also affect the other linked player, but this **excludes kills**. The sew link breaks automatically when a meeting is called.
