## Role Description

The **Clerk** is a Neutral Pariah role. They may vote for someone in a meeting to check their taxes.
If the target has completed a task in the last round (or finished all tasks, or has none remaining), the target receives a **tax refund** (a speed and vision boost for the next round). Otherwise, the target **dies**.

The Clerk only wins with the Crewmates if the game ends due to a task win (meaning everyone "did their taxes"). The Clerk otherwise wins if the Crewmates lose.
